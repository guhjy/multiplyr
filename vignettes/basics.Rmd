The multiplyr package is intended to provide simple and transparent
parallel processing functionality through an interface similar to
one already familiar to many R users (dplyr):

```
# Construct a new data frame
dat <- Multiplyr (x=1:100, G=rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), length.out=100))

# Group data by G
dat %>% group_by (G)

# Summarise length(x) in each group and store in N
dat %>% summarise (N = length(x))
```

To those unfamiliar with dplyr: this package makes heavy use of the
%>% operator, which allows several operations to be chained
together. dat %>% ... results in ... being applied to 
the data frame called dat. 

## Multiplyr is a reference class

There is one surprising thing missing from the above code, which is the
complete absence of an assignment operator, <-, when
group_by and summarise have been used. Since these data
frames represent shared memory, things like group_by modify it 
in place so assigning it back to the same object has no meaning.
Attempting to assign the result of these to a different variable may have
slightly unexpected behaviour.

## Basic operations
### Manipulating columns
define, undefine
rename
select

### Manipulating rows
filter
distinct
slice

### Manipulating data
mutate
transmute
summarise, reduce
within_node
within_group

### Grouping
group_by
group_sizes
ungroup, regroup

### Partitioning
partition_even
partition_group

## No strings attached
Data within a Multiplyr data frame is internally represented numerically,
regardless of whether it's actually numeric or not. At first this may seem
like a limitation, but can potentially make data manipulation very, very
fast. When data in a Multiplyr data frame is updated, e.g. setting a
value to "A", this results in "A" being looked up for that column's
factor levels and then assigned to the underlying numeric matrix.

However, there are times that the actual, specific content of the column
is not relevant. One way to speed up certain operations is therefore to
put the data frame into "no strings attached" mode, which disables any of
these look-ups. For example:

```
# Construct a new data frame
dat <- Multiplyr (G=rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), length.out=100),
                  H=rep(c("p", "q", "r", "s"), each=25))
# Display data
dat["G"]
dat["H"]

# Switch into NSA mode
dat %>% nsa()
dat["G"]
dat["H"]

# Do some things
dat %>% mutate (G=3)

# Switch back
dat %>% nsa(FALSE)
dat["G"]
dat["H"]
```

## Speed considerations

There are some things that are particularly slow with a Multiplyr data
frame. Most notably, initially creating it. The reason for this is that
in the background a new local cluster is started. If you have 4 cores or
CPUs then 4 new instances of R will be started, which can take a few
seconds.

## Limitations

This package is not (yet!) a complete replacement for dplyr and there are
some notable things missing, most notably neat interfacing with SQL
databases.
